Hey there, welcome to my blog! My name is Stephen and I am a final year undergraduate student in honours computer science at **[McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/)**.

**I am broadly interested in developing data-driven methods to model physical systems — with a focus on biomolecular (proteins & small molecules) structure, function, and dynamics.**

More concretely, my current research directions include:
- Developing novel generative frameworks tailored to functional molecular optimization. (**[example](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05234)**)
- Leveraging multimodal contrastive learning to acquire robust and transferable latent representations for chemical perturbation datasets. (**[example](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05196)**)

I have previously been:
- Research intern at:
  - **[BigHat Biosciences](https://www.bighatbio.com/)** — working on **conditional protein language models for antibody optimization**
  - **[The Hospital for Sick Children](https://www.sickkids.ca/en/research/about-research-institute/)** — working on **clinical screening models for upper respiratory and urinary tract infections**
- Co-founding engineer at **[Hero AI](https://www.heroai.ca/)** — working on **clinical automation software**
- Selected as an **[8VC Fellow](https://www.8vc.com/fellowships)**
- Selected as a **[Schulich Scholar](https://schulichleaders.com/)**
- Silver medallist at the '19 **[Canada Wide Science Fair](https://cwsf.youthscience.ca/)**

In my free time, I love playing **pickup basketball** at my local park ([Valois park](https://goo.gl/maps/ZRkXcwmqTR65Zx6L8) in Pointe-Claire if you're from the area), composing mostly funky (and a few serious) songs on the **piano**, discovering breathtaking landscapes nestled in low-profile **hiking** trails (my profile pic above was taken atop [Mt. Wakakusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wakakusa) in Nara, Japan), and spending time with my family and friends in my hometown of **Montreal, Quebec**.

Feel free to reach out **[stephen.lu@mail.mcgill.ca](mailto:stephen.lu@mail.mcgill.ca)** if there is anything you want to discuss!
