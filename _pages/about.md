Hey there, welcome to my blog! My name is Stephen Lu and I am a third year undergraduate student in computer science and biology at **[McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/)**.

My interests are quite broad, but I am particularly fascinated by the areas of **graph representation learning**, **NLP**, and **generative modelling** with applications in chemistry and biology. The microscopic world has always fascinated me â€” how is it that from a handful of atoms and nucleotides, when properly arranged, emerges such a rich diversity of materials and life forms? How can we better understand this relationship between the low-level code of science (atoms, bonds, DNA, etc.) and the high-level properties that characterize their assemblage into useful materials, drugs, and nutrients?

Unfortunately, probing the microscopic world for the answers to such questions remains an arduous endeavour due to the *combinatorial explosion* of possible interactions and arrangements that plague atomic systems of increasing complexity (this is partly why experimentalists have my utmost respect). However, if we make a few *reasonable* assumptions, then the problem becomes less daunting, at least for computers (stay tuned for a new blog post where I'll address this in detail). In this light, my primary research interest lies in developing new **representation learning** techniques that can adequately model the low-level code of molecules and genes.

In my free time, I love playing **pickup basketball** at my local park ([Valois park](https://goo.gl/maps/ZRkXcwmqTR65Zx6L8) in Pointe-Claire if you're from the area), composing mostly funky (and a few serious) songs on the **piano**, discovering breathtaking landscapes nestled in low-profile **hiking** trails (my profile pic above was taken atop [Mt. Wakakusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wakakusa) in Nara, Japan), and spending time with my family and friends in my hometown of **Montreal, Quebec**.

I was previously a co-founder and lead engineer at **[Hero AI](https://www.heroai.ca/)**, where I designed and developed the core frontend architecture for the flagship real-time dashboard and patient beacon products, did research on clinical screening models at the **[Hospital for Sick Children](https://www.sickkids.ca/)**, and completed internships at **Lino AI**, **[The Bagot Lab](https://www.bagotlab.org/)**, and **[The Ferbeyre Lab](http://www.mapageweb.umontreal.ca/ferbeyre/index-en.htm)**.

I am also very grateful to be a **[Schulich Scholar](https://schulichleaders.com/)** and an alumnus of the **[Canada-Wide Science Fair](https://youthscience.ca/science-fairs/)** where I started my STEM journey.
