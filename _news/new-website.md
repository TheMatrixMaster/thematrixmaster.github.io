After 2 years with the same look, I decided to revamp the website using the **[jekyll al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/tree/master)** theme for improved customization and a more feature rich blog. The previous version of the website is still accessible **[here](https://2021.matrixmaster.me)**, but I won't be maintaining it anymore. If I find the time to create a custom theme for the website from scratch, I might do it in the future, but for now I am happy with the current layout. 

I'm also renewing my commitment to blogging and documenting my learning journey with a focus on machine learning or any interesting miscellaneous thoughts. I will be posting more frequently and I hope to be able to share some interesting ideas and projects with you all.
